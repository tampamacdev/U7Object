create a howto document on creating an Ngrok account for tunneling. Explain why this helps to serve a WebSocket service behind a workplace firewall or from a resedential ISP service that doesn't provide a static IP. Explain how Ngrok has a free tier account that provides one static domain, and why this static domain is useful for prototyping/developing a WebSocket service. Explain how easy it will be to demonstrate an embedded web service like mongoose in a C terminal application and give a code snippet demonstrating how to upgrade a web socket connection in mongoose to listen for raw strings from wscat. Give a brief explanation how to install wscat on Windows, Linux and macOS. Please provide an HTML document of your latest response (raw plain text) in a code snippet, the contents of the document should be organized in the style of an actual textbook chapter with the intended audience being someone wanting to learn how to do something for the first time. You can keep the style conversational since most of the contents of this discussion is at its heart a conversation, but try to make the tone more toward anyone and not a particular person asking questions. Do not generate Chapter/Section numbers. Format the HTML document to approximate the rich text rendering of a nice webpage. Include proper HTML tags for headings, bold text, lists, inline code, code blocks, tables, and styled links, with CSS to mimic a modern web UI (system fonts, subtle colors, readable layout). For any code blocks (pre tags), include a functional 'Copy' button in the top-right corner, using JavaScript with the navigator.clipboard API and a fallback for older browsers, styled to match the UI. The 'Copy' button is only to copy the plain text contents of the code snippet. Make the <pre> background-color match the <code> background-color (use #e5e5e5). Make the text color for h1, h2, h3... #1557a0. Keep the color palette darker tones. Ensure the response is a valid HTML document. When including code snippets (e.g., within <pre> or <code> tags), the plain text content must be valid HTML with special characters escapedâ€”e.g., use < for <, > for >, and & for &. This applies especially to text within <p> tags shown as examples in these snippets. The style should be for a general audience and the tone of the output should not be directed toward me.
