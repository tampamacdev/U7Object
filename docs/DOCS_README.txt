This documentation is mainly for supporting Microsoft's itegrated development environment VS Code. The html documentation files in this "docs" folder can be viewed/rendered in VS Code by adding the "Live Preview" extension. Below is a plain text form of the "Installing VS Code Extension" html document linked in the index.html file. 


Adding the Live Preview Tool to VS Code:

- In VS Code, look at the left sidebar and click the square icon with four little boxes (that’s the Extensions button).
- In the search bar at the top, type “Live Preview”.
- Find the one made by Microsoft (it’ll say ms-vscode.live-server next to it).
- Click the green “Install” button. It’ll take a few seconds to download.

Open Your HTML File:

- Go to your project folder in VS Code (use “File” > “Open Folder” if you haven’t already).
- Click on your .html file (like docs/index.html) to open it, but before you click on a .html file, read the section "Turn on Live Preview" below first. After you click on the html item in the file explorer, you should see the code in an editor.

Turn on Live Preview:

- Right-click anywhere in the HTML code.
- From the menu that pops up, pick “Show Preview”.
- A new pane will open on the right side of VS Code, showing what your HTML looks like—like a mini webpage.

Edit and Watch It Update:

- Start typing in the code editor (left side). For example, add <h1>Hello</h1> if it’s blank.
- Look at the preview on the right—it’ll update automatically as you type or save, showing your changes live.
