    <h1>Prompt used to generate "WebSocket Endpoint Architecture" documentation</h1>

    The prompt below was used to autogenerate HTML documentation to explain in detail what is happening in the main() function. The HTML doc was created with "claude code" AI by Anthropic (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219). The commit for the state of claude interaction with the codebase when generating the documentation was 4e2872da4 Feb 27, 2025. 

    <h1>Prompt</h1>
    <p>
        Can you generate a HTML document that explains everything that is happening in the main() function of the websockets_enpoint.vala file. It's obviously a rough codebase to just demonstrate all the fundamental concerns of a multithreaded application that can manage multiple async communication like a websocket connection and local CLI input. But try to do you best to make it sound logical. For example each of the .init() methods are starting a service. Document the purpose of each service. The U7Bridge.init() is kind of unfocues at the moment, but the main purpose of the U7Bridge.init() function is to initialize all the code that is specific to the application and not tied to the foundation classes shared with the C code that is not autogenerated by valac. So the U7Bridge.init() does not initialize a service in the sense of a WebSocket service, but more of initializing all the app specific support classes and the app specific bridge code to the C world. Explain the importance of the U7ThreadLoop.startMainEventLoop() which seems obvious by the naming convention, but try to document the significance of this line being at toward the bottom of the main function and explain that all application termination cleanup code goes below this call. The AppDelegate section of the main function is just to demonstrate how easy it is to subscribe to messages supported by the pub/sub central notification services of the API. Name this HTML document websocket_endpoint.html
