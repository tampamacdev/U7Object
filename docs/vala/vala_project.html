    <h1>Vala Starter Project for WebSocket Endpoint</h1>
    <p>
    This <a href="./vala.html">Vala</a> project shows you how to create a network service that provides a WebSocket endpoint for establishing two way communication between endpoints. It uses the Vala wrapper libraries for the C libraries <a href="./glib_history.html">GLib and JSON-GLib</a>. 

    Is also uses a custom Vala bridge for the embedded web server <a href="./mongoose.html">Mongoose</a>. 
</p>

<p>

    A custom set of classes to mimic macOS standard property list classes (NSString, NSData, NSDate, NSNumber, NSDictionary and NSArray) are included in the Vala starter project. The property list classes also inherit from a parent class that provides convenience methods to encode/decode property lists to/from json data (see <a href="./vala_base_class.html">Custom Vala Base Class</a>).
</p>
<p>
    

    The main purpose of this Vala project is to build an API supporting WebSocket communication between remote systems. The class that performs the heavy lifting is <a href="./inter_thread_communication.html">U7ThreadLoop</a>. I made a decent attempt to document how to subclass and use U7ThreadLoop, but the real documentation, in my honest opinion, is in the implementation file U7ThreadLoop.vala. The Vala file 'U7WebSocketManager.vala' is how this Vala project interfaces with the C code that manages the Mongoose web server. Look at the C file mongoose_vala_bridge.c to get a feel for the possibilities when embedding a lightweight web server into your application. The Mongoose bridge code lets you set the socket port you want to listen on with the start_websocket_server() function. Read the documentation on Ngrok tunneling, found in the <a href="../index.html">home</a> index. This document shows you how to create an account and host your WebSocket service from anywhere. Finally, follow the instructions for building the Vala project <a href="./howto_build.html">here</a>.



</p>
<p>
    The Vala project builds a product named "websocket_endpoint" in the build/ folder. A documentation that explains the initialization steps found in the main() function can be found <a href="./websocket_endpoint.html">here</a>.

</p>
<p>
    Remember, most of this documentation was generated by ChatGPT and Grok, so there might be some mistakes. Inside the Ngrok setup doc, youâ€™ll find a link to a plain text file with the exact prompt used to create the "Ngrok Tunneling Guide" HTML output. That said, I managed to learn Vala programming in under a week using these GPT models, so the AI help was accurate enough to build this useful WebSocket starter kit. Anyone new to programming now has a powerful learning tool in AI. Adapting is key, but so is grasping the basics. Strike a balance, and your productivity will soar.
