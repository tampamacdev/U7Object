Give me a history behind the creation of the Vala language. Give me short histories of the primary creators. Explain what was the inspiration behind creating Vala and what was Vala's original design intent. Give a brief assessment on how Vala evolved and how Vala stayed true to its original design goals. Please provide an HTML document of your latest response (raw plain text) in a code snippet, the contents of the document should be organized in the style of an actual textbook chapter with the intended audience being someone wanting to learn how to do something for the first time. You can keep the style conversational since most of the contents of this discussion is at its heart a conversation, but try to make the tone more toward anyone and not a particular person asking questions. Do not generate Chapter/Section numbers. Format the HTML document to approximate the rich text rendering of a nice webpage. Include proper HTML tags for headings, bold text, lists, inline code, code blocks, tables, and styled links, with CSS to mimic a modern web UI (system fonts, subtle colors, readable layout). For any code blocks (pre tags), include a functional 'Copy' button in the top-right corner, using JavaScript with the navigator.clipboard API and a fallback for older browsers, styled to match the UI. The 'Copy' button is only to copy the plain text contents of the code snippet. Make the &lt;pre&gt; background-color match the &lt;code&gt; background-color (use #e5e5e5). Make the text color for h1, h2, h3... #1557a0. Keep the color palette darker tones. Ensure the response is a valid HTML document. When including code snippets (e.g., within <pre> or <code> tags), the plain text content must be valid HTML with special characters escapedâ€”e.g., use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, and &amp; for &. This applies especially to text within <p> tags shown as examples in these snippets. The style should be for a general audience and the tone of the output should not be directed toward me.
